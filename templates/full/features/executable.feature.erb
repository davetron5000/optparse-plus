Feature: My bootstrapped app kinda works
  In order to get going on coding my awesome app
  I want to have aruba and cucumber setup
  So I don't have to do it myself

  Scenario: App just runs
    When I run `<%= gemname %> --help`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain:
    """
    Usage: <%= gemname %> [options]
    """
